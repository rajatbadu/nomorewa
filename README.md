# NO MORE WA
    • Motivation: 
        ◦ The Students encounter various challenges while solving problems on Competitive Programming Platforms such as CodeChef, CodeForces, Hackerrank, etc.
        ◦  A majority of the beginners having lower mental toughness, leave these platforms because they don’t get an appropriate feedback about their performance.
    • Solution:
        ◦ NO MORE WA focuses on the strong negative sentiment associated with the “WRONG ANSWER” verdict by the Online Judge, which is the primary reason due to which students feel fear in Competitive Programming.
        ◦ The high-rated coders(Reviewer) review the submissions of the relatively low-rated coders(Learner). As a reward, the Reviewers receive academic marks or any incentive decided by the Faculty members.
    • Scope:
        ◦ This will be currently valid only for academic institutions willing to participate.
